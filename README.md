# My Web Project

This project is a web application that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

## What are HTML, CSS and JavaScript?

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the three main languages of web development. They work together to define the structure, style and behavior of a web page.

- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the language that defines the content and the semantic meaning of a web page. It uses tags to mark different elements, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, etc.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that defines the appearance and layout of a web page. It uses rules to apply styles to HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, backgrounds, borders, margins, etc.
- JavaScript is the language that defines the interactivity and functionality of a web page. It uses scripts to manipulate HTML elements, respond to user events, communicate with servers, perform calculations, etc.
